### Names and nebulosity

Names are hard to systematize. My friend’s father, who worked for a long time at a certain aerospace manufacturer told me an anecdote about this that stuck with me:

```Two airplane wing-engineers stand over a blueprint for the latest 7-series plane. One has hand clutching his hair as the other points aggressively at him.

“Engine 1 and engine 2? That’s ridiculous! How is a mechanic on the runway supposed to know which wing to service without an entire blueprint? Left engine and right engine is so much more logical.”

“What about the legacy system? Nothing else on the wing is called left or right. We can’t just ignore decades of calling convention because one pettifogging engineer thinks it’s stupid.”

Yet another engineer chimes in: “Well actually, you know the 6-series had Flap A and Flap B, and obviously A refers to the left side of the plane, so we should call them Engine A and Engine B.

They stare indignantly at each others’ eyes, refusing to back down.```

The reason that this (admittedly embellished) anecdote is interesting to me is because it hits upon an issue that is important yet often overlooked: naming.

At first blush, naming parts of a system seems straightforward: just make sure that the names for device Z and subpart 2 don’t overlap (unique identification), that everyone has a common list of names (broad recognition), and there you have it. But as should be evident from the anecdote, a (good) naming system does much more than uniquely identify and provide broad recognition.

Last names provide a more interesting example. Zhao, Weinstein, Lamplighter — did you know that surnames were initially imposed as a means for the state to tax and control citizens? This is not some anti-government theory. The Qin dynasty began imposing surnames as a way to consistently tax and conscript people at around fourth century B.C. [1]. European surnames weren’t even standardized until at least the fourteenth century[2]. Your first name was sufficient to identify anyone you needed to find (and still is, among the people you know directly). It was only the desire of the local government to prevent tax evasion and maintain armies of (peasant) laborers/soldiers that permanent patronyms were established.

In the sprawling ‘Seeing Like A State’, James C Scott uses the fifteenth century Tuscan state’s failed census (catasto) as an example of the difficulty that states faced in imposing names:

“When making his declaration, a typical Tuscan provided not only his own given name but those of his father and perhaps his grandfather as well, in quasi-biblical fashion (Luigi, son of Giovanni, son of Paolo). Given the limited number of baptismal names and the tendency of many families to repeat names in alternate generations, even this sequence might not suffice for unambiguous identification. The subject might then add his profession, his nickname, or a personal characteristic… In the final analysis, the Florentine state was inadequate to the administrative feat intended by the catasto. Popular resistance, the noncompliance of many local elites, and the arduousness and cost of the census exercise doomed the project, and officials returned to the earlier fiscal system.”[italics mine]. [3]

Like the original aircraft engineers, the Florentine government struggled impose a naming scheme that would be adopted in part because choosing unique identifiers was difficult, but also because the names had to be used by people, and people expect certain things from names.

Namely, that they should be logical, easy to say, and memorable. Were our early governments more technocratic and capable, our last names could have been ‘AJK598J’ and ‘3KH44E2’. Seven alphanumeric characters allow for 36^6 = ~80 billion unique combinations, making it unique, concise and easy to store in a database. But instead our last names are Miller (whose ancestors owned a mill), Thompson (who at some point had an ancestor called ‘Tom’), and Ma/馬 (whose ancestor was a particular bureaucrat during the Warring State period).

Whenever you come up with a naming system, you better think carefully about how this system is going to interact with your subjects’ current habits. Asking Michael Short to become Michael SH7G998 imposes a huge cognitive cost in terms of everyone he interacts with relearn his name, but also in terms of the emotional attachment he had to his old name. And deciding to call that outer flap on the airplane wing ‘Aileron A’ or ‘Left Aileron’ could make the difference between a disaster from a mis-serviced engine (“Oh I thought engine A was on the right”) and a roomful of productive engineers.

Much of this might seem obvious— ‘of course you want to include feedback from people when you make decisions that effect them’. But then why is there so much anger towards YouTube [for its polarizing tendencies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html)? Why are people angry at Facebook for [maximizing screen time with clickbait](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-screen-time-digital-wellness-tech-addiction/)? It’s because only very rarely are the subjects of these platforms and algorithms deeply engaged with and heard. Most engineers engage their subjects (and their successors) in a very superficial way, and this is the root of many of the problems that we have with technology.
