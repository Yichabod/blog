I think and write about technology and society. Sometimes I build things too. Things I’m currently pondering:

- How can institutions navigate between stifling bureaucracy and collectivist anarchy?
- How can one create scaffolding between spiritual practice, gestalt therapies, and adjacent modalities?
- What do emerging technologies herald for humanity and the planet?

I graduated in 2022 from MIT with a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in computer science. I’ve also dabbled in economics and philosophy. Right now I'm advocating for minimal security standards for benchtop DNA synthesizers, with the support of [SecureDNA](https://securedna.org). You can find my complete thesis [here](/how_MLOSS_shapes_AI.pdf), the thesis-based paper I submitted to AIES [here](/AIES_paper.pdf), and a blog post I wrote summarizing both [here](posts/mloss_essay). 

In the past, I’ve been a data research analyst at the wonderful [Center for Security and Emerging Technology](https://cset.georgetown.edu/), a researcher for the [Metagovernance Project](https://metagov.org/), a policy intern at the [White House Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/), and a researcher at the [MIT Computational Cognitive Science group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/).

Intellectual influences of mine include [Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom), [Nadia Aspourahova](https://nadia.xyz), and [David Chapman](https://meaningness.com/about-my-sites). I am deeply grateful to them and their mutuals for inspiring me and shaping my worldview.
