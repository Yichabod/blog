### Professional

I graduated in 2022 from MIT with a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in computer science. I’ve also dabbled in economics and philosophy. 

You can find my complete thesis [here](/how_MLOSS_shapes_AI.pdf), the thesis-based paper I submitted to AI Ethics and Society [here](/AIES_paper.pdf), and a blog post I wrote summarizing both [here](posts/mloss_essay). 

Selected past jobs:
- Data analysis and policy at the [Center for Security and Emerging Technology](https://cset.georgetown.edu/)
- ███████ at In-Q-Tel
- 5G and AI Policy at [White House Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/)
- Reinforcement learning to model human behavior at the [MIT Computational Cognitive Science group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/)
- Playing around with TensorFlow at Cerebras



### Projects

- [plugging in a USB: what's the worst that can happen?](/BadUSB.pdf). Where some friends and I use a Raspberry Pi Zero to inject malicious keystrokes into my computer. For MIT's Computer Systems Security class (6.858).
- [deep learning with satellite data](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-with-satellite-data-b78b20708de). A writeup of the landslide detection project I did as a visiting researcher at University of Sannio.
- [building an arduino sleep tracking device](https://medium.com/@Yichabod/the-difficulty-with-tracking-sleep-4dffbed6bbab). An amateurish IoT project with some friends for MIT's Embedded Systems class (6.08).
- [using LSTMs to imagine how Shakespeare would have rapped](https://medium.com/@Yichabod/how-would-shakespeare-have-rapped-a-practical-implementation-of-lstms-for-text-synthesis-2fece570eb8e). My first ever real programming project.
